I have changed what i think i could change for now. If there is more that i was expected to add, please rather mark this as
incomplete so I can improve where needed so i can do so and book a mentor call if needed-->

    <p>As a recent graduate, I have embarked on establishing my career and presence in the working
        world. As of January 2021, I commenced working at Auto & Truck Tyres as an imports clerk. This
        role has helped me put into practice learnings from my tertiary education and develop my key
        competencies. After which I have joined the shipping team at TiAuto Investments in 2022 as a junior
        exporter to further elevate my knowledge in the field of imports, export, and logistics and to
        further my personal development and growth. I enjoy being challenged, am invested in self-growth
        and committed to progressing my career.</p>

<!-- Some things to note:
1) The indenting makes no difference to the meaning of the code above - it makes it easier to read and know what elements fall under which other elements, i.e. if a paragraph relates to heading 1 or 2.
	
2) The opening and closing of tags, and how they are nested correctly.
	
3) The basic elements - p, h(number 1-6), b, em -->
